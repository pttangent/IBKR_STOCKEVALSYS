    symbol="{symbol}",
    exchange="SMART",
    genericTickList="100,101,104,105,106,165,221,225,233,236,258,411"
)
```

✅ IV < HV = Options relatively cheap (good for buyers)
⚠️ IV > HV = Options expensive (good for sellers)
```

### 2. Historical Price Analysis
**Tool**: `ibkr_get_historical_data`

#### Short-Term Trend (5 days, 5-minute bars):
```
ibkr_get_historical_data(
    symbol="{symbol}",
    duration="5 D",
    barSize="5 mins",
    whatToShow="TRADES"
)
```

**Calculate Intraday Metrics**:
```python
# From 5-day intraday data
recent_high = max(bars.high)
recent_low = min(bars.low)
current_price = last_bar.close

# Position in range
range_position = (current_price - recent_low) / (recent_high - recent_low)
# 0.0 = at low, 0.5 = mid-range, 1.0 = at high

# Intraday momentum
sma_20 = average(last 20 bars)
if current_price > sma_20:
    trend = "Bullish (above 20-bar SMA)"
else:
    trend = "Bearish (below 20-bar SMA)"
```

#### Medium-Term Trend (6 months, daily bars):
```
ibkr_get_historical_data(
    symbol="{symbol}",
    duration="6 M",
    barSize="1 day",
    whatToShow="TRADES"
)
```

**Calculate Technical Indicators**:
```python
# Moving averages
sma_50 = average(last 50 days)
sma_200 = average(last 200 days)

# Trend classification
if sma_50 > sma_200 and price > sma_50:
    trend = "Strong Uptrend (Golden Cross)"
elif sma_50 < sma_200 and price < sma_50:
    trend = "Strong Downtrend (Death Cross)"
else:
    trend = "Consolidation or Transition"

# Support and resistance
support = recent_swing_low
resistance = recent_swing_high

# Average True Range (ATR) for volatility
atr_14 = average(true_range for last 14 days)
volatility_percent = (atr_14 / current_price) * 100
```

#### Long-Term Trend (2 years, weekly bars):
```
ibkr_get_historical_data(
    symbol="{symbol}",
    duration="2 Y",
    barSize="1 week",
    whatToShow="TRADES"
)
```

**Identify Major Patterns**:
```
- Multi-month channels
- Key breakout/breakdown levels
- Seasonal trends
- Long-term momentum (52-week high/low)
```

### 3. Volatility Analysis
**Tool**: `ibkr_get_histogram_data`
```
ibkr_get_histogram_data(
    symbol="{symbol}",
    period="3 months",
    barCount=100
)
```

**Volatility Metrics**:
```python
# Historical volatility
std_dev = standard_deviation(returns)
hist_vol_annual = std_dev * sqrt(252) * 100

# Compare to implied volatility
iv_current = from market_data
vol_spread = iv_current - hist_vol_annual

# Interpretation
if vol_spread > 5:
    signal = "IV elevated - consider selling options"
elif vol_spread < -5:
    signal = "IV depressed - consider buying options"
else:
    signal = "IV fairly priced"

# VIX-style volatility regime
if hist_vol_annual < 15:
    regime = "Low volatility - range-bound expected"
elif hist_vol_annual < 25:
    regime = "Normal volatility"
else:
    regime = "High volatility - elevated risk"
```

### 4. News and Sentiment Analysis
**Tool**: `ibkr_get_news_articles`
```
ibkr_get_news_articles(
    symbol="{symbol}",
    providerCodes="BRFUPDN",  # Query each enumerated provider separately for comparable coverage
    totalResults=10,
    startDateTime="YYYYMMDD HH:mm:ss US/Eastern",
    endDateTime="YYYYMMDD HH:mm:ss US/Eastern"
)
```

**Analyze Recent News**:
```
Review headlines inside the explicitly supplied time window:
1. Earnings announcements
2. Product launches
3. Regulatory news
4. Analyst upgrades/downgrades
5. Sector rotation news

Keep `providerCode`, `time`, and `articleId`; deduplicate repeated stories across providers. Fetch full text with `ibkr_get_news_article` only for selected catalysts. An empty result requires checking provider availability, contract qualification, time range, and TWS errors before concluding that no news exists.

Sentiment Score:
- Count positive headlines: ___
- Count negative headlines: ___
- Net sentiment: Bullish/Neutral/Bearish
```

**Tool**: `ibkr_start_news_resource`

For continuous monitoring:
```
ibkr_start_news_resource(
    symbol="{symbol}",
    providerCodes="BRFUPDN"
)
```
**Resource URI**: `ibkr://tick-news/{symbol}`

### 5. Options Market Analysis
**Tool**: `ibkr_get_option_chain`
```
ibkr_get_option_chain(
    symbol="{symbol}",
    secType="STK",
    exchange="SMART"
)
```

**Analyze Options Data**:

#### Implied Volatility Term Structure:
```
Get IV for different expirations:
- 1 week: ___%
- 1 month: ___%
- 3 months: ___%

Upward sloping = Market expects increasing volatility
Downward sloping = Market expects decreasing volatility

```

#### Put/Call Skew:
```
Compare ATM put IV vs ATM call IV:
- ATM Put IV: ___%
- ATM Call IV: ___%
- Skew: ___ (Put IV - Call IV)

Positive skew = Downside protection demand (bearish)
Negative skew = Upside speculation (bullish)
```

#### Open Interest Analysis:
```
# Get specific strikes with high OI
Max Call OI Strike: $___ (resistance level)
Max Put OI Strike: $___ (support level)

Heavy OI = Magnetic price level (dealers hedge)
```

**Tool**: `ibkr_get_market_data` (for specific options)

Get detailed Greeks for ATM options:
```
ibkr_get_market_data(
    symbol="{symbol} ATM_Call",
    exchange="SMART",
    genericTickList="100,101,104,105,106"
)
```

**Key Greeks**:
```
Delta: Directional bias
Gamma: Acceleration potential
Vega: Volatility sensitivity
Theta: Time decay rate
```

ibkr_get_market_data(
    symbol="{benchmark}",
    exchange="SMART",
    genericTickList="100,101,104,105,106"
)
```

**Relative Performance**:
```python
# Get historical data for both
symbol_returns = calculate_returns("{symbol}")
benchmark_returns = calculate_returns("{benchmark}")

# Beta calculation
covariance = cov(symbol_returns, benchmark_returns)
variance = var(benchmark_returns)
beta = covariance / variance

# Alpha calculation
expected_return = risk_free_rate + beta * (benchmark_return - risk_free_rate)
alpha = actual_return - expected_return

# Correlation
correlation = corr(symbol_returns, benchmark_returns)
```

**Interpretation**:
```
Beta > 1: More volatile than {benchmark}
Beta < 1: Less volatile than {benchmark}
Alpha > 0: Outperforming expectations
Correlation < 0.7: Diversification benefit

## Advanced Analysis Techniques

### Multi-Factor Scoring System
```python
# Weight different factors
technical_score = 7  # 0-10
fundamental_score = 6
sentiment_score = 8
options_score = 7

# Weighted average (adjust weights as needed)
weights = {{
    'technical': 0.3,
    'fundamental': 0.3,
    'sentiment': 0.2,
    'options': 0.2
}}

overall_score = (
    technical_score * 0.3 +
    fundamental_score * 0.3 +
    sentiment_score * 0.2 +
    options_score * 0.2
)
# Result: 7.0/10 = Moderately bullish
```

### Regime Detection
```
Identify market regime:
1. Bull Market: Uptrend + Low VIX + Positive breadth
2. Bear Market: Downtrend + High VIX + Negative breadth
3. Consolidation: Sideways + Medium VIX + Mixed breadth
4. Crisis: Sharp drop + Extreme VIX + Panic selling

Current Regime: ___
Strategy Adjustment: ___
```

### Correlation Analysis
```
Check correlations with:
- {benchmark} (market correlation)

- Competitors (industry correlation)

Low correlation = Good diversifier
High correlation = Redundant exposure
```
